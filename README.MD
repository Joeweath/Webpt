I first and formost would like to thank you for this oppurtunity.  I apologize for not making the most out of it.  I was not to familiar with classes and implementing methods within those classes.  I was wavering back and fourth on if I should spend more then one hour to complete this excercise.  I feel confident I could of figured it out, however I didn't feel comfortable breaking your rules to complete this challenge.  

If I had more time I would of first researched how to implent methods and return promises.

My next hurrdle would of been working on iterating over the source object recursiverly.

Thank you for this oppurtunity, I hope I get the oppurtunity to show that I would be better then any other canidate in the long run and the perfect fit for the team.
